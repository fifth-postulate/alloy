# Alloy and Time

Since Alloy 6, Alloy has support for time.

Explain:

- `var`
- `x` and `x'`
- Regular `fact`s are now initialization, `always` facts represent invariants
- `always`/`eventually`

## Checking time

Run: put an `and` of what you would like to see. Check that the specification is
satisfiable.

Check: put an implication to check for termination.

## The visualizer and Time

- The visualizer buttons and progression

## Frame conditions

(Trivial model here with 2 `var`s, leave out frame conditions)

**EXERCISE**: Run the above program. What happened? Why did that happen?

A light touch of frame conditions.

Frame conditions can be written in a couple of different styles. We will see
a couple of different styles later.
