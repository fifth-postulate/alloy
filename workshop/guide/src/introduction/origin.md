# Origin
This workshop originated after an observation. Software development toots the
horn of chosing the right tool for the job. But all to often development is
jumped started by creating a project in their favorite, general purpose,
programming language.
Each problem is a challenge in modelling and design, followed by expressing the
model and the accompanying algorithms in code.

Although it seems that the modern approach eskews upfront modeling, we feel 
that it still has a place in the software development process. Especially
when it allows to gain rapid feedback about the implication of various design
decisions.

Alloy is such a tool that allows to collect feedback in an early phase,
without the substantial investment in more elaborate formal verification
methods.

We like to take you on a journey to convince you of the insight.
