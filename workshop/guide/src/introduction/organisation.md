# Organization
The material is organized around different concepts. Each concept has its own section.
It is intended to be self-contained and should be allow for working through in
any order.

Within a concept you should start at the beginning and work through the material
until:

1. You are confident that you have an good understanding of the concept,
2. You are bored and want something new to learn.

Please don't forget that although you are learning valuable tool, you learn the
best when you are having fun. If you lost concentration, or otherwise don't
feel engaged; stop, don't worry, take a break and come back to it at a later
point in time.
