# Arity

> The number of arguments or operands taken by a function, operation of relation.

We said that a relation is a set of tuples. Tuples can have any finite number
of components. And we can recognize such relations as well.

For example; a banks ledger relates, among other things, a transaction with a
sender and a receiver. The relation _ledger_ has three components. In other
words it has arity 3.

**EXERCISE**: Think of a relation that relates more than two items.

**EXERCISE**: We have seen relations of arity 2 and 3. What about other arities?
Can you think of a relation of arity 1?

**EXERCISE**: What, if any, would be the significance of a relation with arity
zero?

Although a relation can use any finite number of components, we tend to disallow
mixing multiple arities in a single relations. Although nothing is preventing
you from forming sets of tuples with different arities, you will have a hard
time interpreted those relations without context.

## Summary

> Relations can have any arity, but each relation only has a single arity.
