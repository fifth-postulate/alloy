# Characteristics

A relation is a set of tuples where each tuple has a fixed arity. In this
chapter we will list some properties a relation could have.

A canonical relation to keep in mind during this chapter is a relation on
numbers; `≤` (less-then-or-equal-to).  

## Reflexive
A relation R on a collection A is _reflexive_ if for each element `a` in A, `a`
is related to itself, i.e. `(a,a)` in R.

The less-then-or-equal-to relation on numbers is an example of a relation that
is reflexive. For each number, for example 37, it is the case that it is
less-then-or-equal-to it self. E.g. `37 ≤ 37`.

**EXERCISE**: Think of a relation that is **not** reflexive.

**EXERCISE**: Is it the case that most relation are reflexive?
